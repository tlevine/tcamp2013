AppGen: Algorithmically generated civic apps from open data

Nobody can deny the success of NYC's open data portal. It has become an essential resource, driving the development in new fields of civic technology, transparency, and analysis of the public sector. AppGen is an easy-to-use, open-source platform that takes this data exploration one step further. It computationally constructs all possible data mashups from the NYC open data portal, then empowers people to submit them as standalone apps to civic app challenges.

AppGen takes all the datasets from the NYC Data Portal, analyzes them to find stochastic linkages, merges disparate datasets, visualizes them in the form of standalone apps, writes product copy and composes a visual brand. This novel form of rapidly prototyping facilitates the spatial understanding of NYC Open Data with interactive, story-telling apps.
